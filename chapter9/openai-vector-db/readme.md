Vector DB Insert
   


- What should i start with abstraction or an endpoint?
 
Abstraction makes people to understand more , which should often come last.

we will go for actual project 


Every entry to be inserted to be converted to a Document object. If we want 

```java

new Document("Vaccum CL")
```

Every entry into VectorStore Table can be done only after Constructing a Document Object , So to Create a Document Object for a content

```text
 

```



vaccum-cleaners.text
```md

```














VectorStore has a method named add which will help you to insert documents within the database. Only thing is you cannot insert single entry , rather you have to insert multiple entries at once.
