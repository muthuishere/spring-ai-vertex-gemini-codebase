You're maintaining a book chapter in `#file:book.md` originally written for an older Spring AI version. You've now updated all example implementations and organized them into separate folders (like `#file:1-llama-service`).

Your goal is to **map sections of the book to the appropriate updated example folders** so that future edits stay aligned with actual working code and update the file #chapter-sections-mapping.md

### üß© Task:

Produce a document titled:

> **Chapter 10 Sections and Example Mappings**

The output should include:

---

#### üìò Section to Example Folder Mapping

A table like this:

| Section   | Example Folder          | Description                            |
| --------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 10.2 - 10.10 | `<example-folder-name>` | Short summary of what that folder does |

Use actual GitHub links or filenames (if available in `book.md`) to help decide the folder for each section.

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

* Point out any **incorrect or outdated links** currently used in `book.md` (e.g. if section 10.10 refers to `1-conversation` when it should be `2-conversation-advisor`)
* Mention line numbers from `book.md` where applicable for traceability

---

#### üîÑ Suggested Updates

Include specific alignment fixes like:

* Update GitHub link in section 10.10 to point to `2-conversation-advisor`
* Ensure all code snippets in book match the example code

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Constraints

* **Do not rewrite** book.md
* **Do not change** the original style
* Just generate a **mapping + correction plan** and update in file named `#file:chapter-sections-mapping.md`
