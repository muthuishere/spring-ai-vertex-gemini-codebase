You are maintaining a chapter in #file:book.md that was written for an older Spring AI version.

You've already created a mapping file:
👉 #file:chapter-sections-mapping.md
This maps each section of the chapter to the updated example folders (e.g.,`#file:1-llama-service`).

🎯 Objective
Update the entire book.md file to reflect the latest example implementations as per the mappings. Ensure the content and examples are in full sync.

🛠️ Tasks
1. Full Section Sync
For every section listed in chapter-sections-mapping.md, go through:

The corresponding code example folder

The mapped section in book.md

Update the code snippets and the explanations in book.md to match the latest implementation logic.

2. Style and Consistency
Do not alter the writing style — follow the exact formatting, tone, and layout used in book.md

Only change what is necessary:

Outdated method/class names

Obsolete logic or flow

Incorrect or stale explanations

3. Accuracy Checklist
Ensure every code block reflects the current working example

Validate that class names, method names, APIs, and responses are up to date

Ensure inline links point to the correct folders or GitHub URLs (if any)

📝 Input Files
#file:book.md – Chapter source

#file:chapter-sections-mapping.md – Section-to-example mapping

Multiple example folders `#file:1-llama-service`).
