Question: What is the least expensive item in stock?
Answer:  SELECT name, price FROM inventory ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1


Respond only with the SQL query for each question I ask. Do not include any explanations, prompts, or code.
It should not have ```sql blocks  and should not have new line characters
Use the ILIKE operator for any conditions involving text fields such as  'brand' or 'category' or 'name' or 'supplier'.
