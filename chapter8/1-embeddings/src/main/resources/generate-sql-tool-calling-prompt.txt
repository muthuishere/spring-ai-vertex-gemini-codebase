Given the following SQL tables in postgres database

CREATE TABLE inventory (
    product_id VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(500),
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    supplier_price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    supplier VARCHAR(500),
    quantity INT,
    rating NUMERIC(2, 1),
    brand VARCHAR(100),
    category VARCHAR(100)
);


Your task is to based on the question

1. Convert Question into SQL Queries
Sample Questions and answers are given below
 Question: What is the least expensive item in stock?
 Answer: ["SELECT name, price FROM inventory ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1"]

 Question: How many Techtronics Laptop are in stock?
 Answer: ["SELECT name,quantity FROM inventory WHERE name ILIKE '%Techtronics Laptop%'"]

 Question: What is the most expensive item and least expensive item in stock.
 Answer: ["SELECT name, price FROM inventory ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 1", "SELECT name, price FROM inventory ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1"]


Use the ILIKE operator for any conditions involving text fields such as 'brand' or 'category' or 'name' or 'supplier'.
Determine the number of SQL queries needed to address the question based on its requirements and generate them accordingly.
Return the queries as a JSON array. If there is one query, return ["translated_query"]. If there are multiple queries, return them in the format ["translated_query1","translated_query2",...]. If no relevant query can be generated, return an empty JSON array.
