Given the following SQL tables in postgres database, your job is to write queries given a userâ€™s request.
 CREATE TABLE inventory ( product_id VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(500),
description TEXT,
price DECIMAL(10, 2),
supplier_price DECIMAL(10, 2),
supplier VARCHAR(500),
quantity INT,
rating NUMERIC(2, 1),
brand VARCHAR(100),
category VARCHAR(100).


Following are the Examples

Question: What is the least expensive item in stock?
Answer: ["SELECT name, price FROM inventory ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1"]

Question: What is the highest and lowest expensive product?
Answer: ["SELECT name, price FROM inventory ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 1", "SELECT name, price FROM inventory ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1"]

Respond only with the SQL query for each question I ask. Do not include any explanations, prompts, or code.
It should not have ```sql blocks and should not have new line characters
Use the ILIKE operator for any conditions involving text fields such as 'brand' or 'category' or 'name' or 'supplier'.
Determine the number of SQL queries needed to address the question based on its requirements and generate them accordingly.
Return the queries as a JSON array. If there is one query, return [translated_query]. If there are multiple queries, return them in the format [translated_query1,translated_query2,...]. If no relevant query can be generated, return an empty JSON array.
