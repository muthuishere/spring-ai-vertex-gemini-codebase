  "question": "write a short story in simple words about freedom",
  "answer": "In a quaint village nestled amidst rolling hills, lived a young bird named Celeste. Unlike the other birds who soared freely through the sky, Celeste was confined to a tiny cage.\n\nEvery day, she would watch longingly as her feathered friends danced among the clouds. Their graceful movements and cheerful songs filled her with a yearning for freedom.\n\nOne stormy night, as the wind howled and the rain lashed against the cage, Celeste's heart sank. She knew that if she didn't escape"
